# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
// Feel pretty good with `for` statements.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
// Had a productive struggle in figure out challenge number 3.
almost had it all done with one part not matching up to print correctly but another student helped me firgure it out.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
// Do not need to adjust the calendar but practicing more complex for statements will help me get a better grasp on it.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
// No questions for now, but when the come up, I will ask my peers or my instructors if they can show me to better understand.
